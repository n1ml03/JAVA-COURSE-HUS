Using Bubble Sort Algorithm:
Before sorting: [5, 9, 2, 5, 5, 12, 0, 8, 6, 16]
After sorting: [0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16]
Number of swap: 15

Using Selection Sort Algorithm:
Before sorting: [5, 9, 2, 5, 5, 12, 0, 8, 6, 16]
After sorting: [0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16]
Number of swap: 7

Using Insertion Sort Algorithm:
Before sorting: [5, 9, 2, 5, 5, 12, 0, 8, 6, 16]
After sorting: [0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16]
Number of swap: 24
